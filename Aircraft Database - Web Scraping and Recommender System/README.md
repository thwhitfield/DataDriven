## Aircraft Database - Web Scraping and Recommender System

For this independent project, I created a sortable, filterable, and searchable database of all aircraft designs listed on wikipedia. I believe this is the first free database of that type online. To create the database, I scraped the aircraft specifications and wikipedia page content for all the aircraft listed on wikipedia, parsed that data, and created a database with it. I uploaded that database to this github page. I also created a specification based aircraft recommender system, such that given an aircraft the system will return aircraft of similar specifications.

The final database has approximately 10,000 aircraft, and includes specifications like: wingspan, length, height, empty weight, gross weight, maximum speed, cruise speed, and stall speed. The database also includes the manufacturer, aircraft role, number of aircraft built, first flight year, and national origin.

The code is separated into 6 files, and the resulting database has been uploaded to this [website](https://thwhitfield.github.io/Aircraft-Database/index.html).

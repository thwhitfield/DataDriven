### General Aviation Aircraft Accident Analysis
For this independent project, I did exploratory analysis on the aircraft accident database provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), with the goal of determining the important factors that contribute to an aircraft's accident being fatal. Next, I created a classifier to predict whether a given accident will be fatal based on characteristics of the aircraft, pilot, and general conditions of the flight before the accident.

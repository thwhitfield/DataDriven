## General Aviation Aircraft Accident Analysis

[Jupyter Notebook analysis link](https://github.com/thwhitfield/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/master/General%20Aviation%20Aircraft%20Accident%20Analysis/General_Aviation_Aircraft_Accident_Analysis.ipynb)

For this independent project, I did exploratory analysis on the aircraft accident database provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), with the goal of determining the important factors that contribute to an aircraft's accident being fatal. Next, I created a classifier to predict whether a given accident will be fatal based on characteristics of the aircraft, pilot, and general conditions of the flight before the accident.

#### Map of General Aviation Aircraft Accidents
I also created an interactive map of general aviation aircraft accidents. Here is the [script](https://github.com/thwhitfield/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/master/General%20Aviation%20Aircraft%20Accident%20Analysis/Mapping_General_Aviation_Aircraft_Accidents.ipynb) to produce the map, and here is the [map](https://github.com/thwhitfield/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/master/General%20Aviation%20Aircraft%20Accident%20Analysis/General_Aviation_Accident_Map_2010_to_present.html) itself.
